issue arises in frontend when the server may not be functioning properly and didn't create the root dir,
yet it registers them in firebase. maybe delete account or do some type of promise.
or just handle only user registration and not user login in the backend, so it can be apart of that big transaction.

the same with the backend, but an easy fix is to do a transaction for everything
