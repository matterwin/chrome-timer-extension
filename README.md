# How it works

Real-time timer on client side.
Whenever client wants to save their time, it'll send a request to backend to process if the user has a registered account.

Folders will be show that time saves of a user generated/saved by them.

Goal is to track the amount of time spent on a particular task/website.

Potential monetization: selling the time users spend and the where.
Users can opt out of this, of course.
Donations or ads.

Not a money making app, but useful.
